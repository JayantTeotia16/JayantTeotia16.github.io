I have been a research assistant at Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore, since last year. My projects incorporate analyzing deep neural networks for image detection and segmentation for different modalities(Electro-optical and IR/Depth) and creating a novel method to improve segmentation accuracy for the missing modality scenario. For this, I have been researching fusion at image and feature levels, knowledge distillation, and contrastive learning. 

Having experimented with language models has also given me considerable experience in working with NLP models. In broad terms, I am enthusiastic about contributing to the progression of AI in both NLP and computer vision. If you would like to explore my work further or discuss potential collaboration on a project, please contact me via LinkedIn.

  In the late 20th century, in a quaint northern Indian town, Jayant was introduced to this world. This was an era poised on the brink of a monumental shift into the age of the internet, a time when digital interconnectivity was on the cusp of a breathtaking and, indeed, unfathomable integration into human civilization. India, however, remained somewhat distant from this rapid evolution, much like Jayant himself.

  In a city near the Indian capital, Delhi, the hustle and bustle of human existence mirrored the nation's aspirations to become an economic and scientific powerhouse. Everyday people strived to find their footing in a world that was yet to fully embrace modernity. Amidst this backdrop, Jayant pursued the fundamentals of science and mathematics, dabbling in introductory programming at a modest school, far from the chaos of the metropolis.

  Surprisingly, Jayant's academic prowess shone brightly, earning him numerous accolades in the fields of science and mathematics, along with remarkable success in science and math Olympiads. He graduated from high school with exceptional grades, little suspecting the dramatic turn his life was about to take.

  As digital infrastructure advanced, research into Artificial Intelligence began to gain momentum. The introduction of the ImageNet challenge in the early 2010s marked a pivotal moment when Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) made a resounding entrance. It was during this time that Jayant, while preparing for the highly competitive entrance exam to join the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology, found his academic journey briefly interrupted.

  After a one-year hiatus, he secured admission with a percentile score exceeding 99%. Opting for mechanical engineering due to his inclination for tinkering with machinery, Jayant embarked on a journey filled with various projects. However, it was autonomous driving that captured his imagination. His educational focus shifted towards computer science, an area not extensively covered in his major, leading him to self-study and eventually select an appropriate bachelor's thesis.

  Jayant's deep dive into this self-chosen path affected his grades during the latter part of his undergraduate degree. Nevertheless, upon graduation, instead of seeking immediate employment, he chose a position at the esteemed Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to further cultivate his professional skills.

  During this era, the world grappled with an overwhelming surge of data, unsure of how to harness its limitless potential. It was in this transformative period that transformers were introduced, laying the groundwork for massive language models with astonishingly vast training parameters. The emergence of these Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models marked a revolutionary moment, impacting search engines, sparking new startups, transforming existing jobs, and even redefining art.

  Jayant's primary focus at this juncture centered on the use of neural networks for computer vision. His work included creating CNNs for image segmentation and detection, employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and exploring diffusion models for data generation.

  Now, in the present, Jayant and the ever-evolving world find themselves standing at a crucial juncture, tasked with leveraging these creative innovations and inventions to address the remaining limitations, as they continue to shape the future.
