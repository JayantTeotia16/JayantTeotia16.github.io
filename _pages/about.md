I currently work as a research assistant at RBCCPS, IISc Bangalore. My research project is based on image segmentation in multi-modal(EO-IR/Depth) scenarios. To this end, I am working to improve the mean accuracy in the case of missing modality which incorporates knowledge distillation from a single source to better generalize/fuse the image features in feature space. I am also making use of contrastive learning and loss mix augmentation and evolving them for the segmentation task.

Fundamentally, my interests lie in AI in computer vision, though my curiosity in NLP has led me in experimenting with transformers for LLM. I would be interested in a research opportunity on topics of multi-modal image segmentation, fusion, generalization and NLP. If you would like to know more about my research or want to collaborate on a project, please reach me out through LinkedIn.
