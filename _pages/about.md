I am working as a research assistant at RBCCPS, IISc Bangalore. My research project is based on multi-modal(EO-IR/Depth) fusion and missing modality image segmentation. It incorporates knowledge distillation from one source to generalize/fuse the image features in latent space. I am using contrastive learning and loss mix augmentation, and optimizing them for multi-modal scenarios.

Essentially, my interests lie in AI in computer vision and I would be interested in a research opportunity in multi-modal image segmentation, fusion, and generalization. If you would like to know more about my research or want to collaborate on a project, please reach me out through Email/LinkedIn.
