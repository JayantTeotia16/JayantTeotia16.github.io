The idea of Jayant was concepted in 1997 in a small town of northern India. 



Currently, I am a Research Associate at Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore. My work mainly incorporates deep neural networks for image detection and segmentation for images of different modalities(Electro-optical and IR/Depth). This work also entails research on contrastive learning, gated fusion units and lossmix augmentations.
