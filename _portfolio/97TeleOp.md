This project was completed during my research internship at ARTPARK. The objective was to teleoperate Volta(a ground robot vehicle) in another lab by visual information streamed through an intel D35I stereo camera and ROS. Furthur, the LIDAR mapping of the lab was performed using the teleoperation.
