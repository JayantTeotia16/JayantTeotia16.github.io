* Spearheaded the design and fabrication of a warehouse robot, incorporating a stationary robotic arm and a four-wheeled differential drive bot.
* Engineered an electrical circuit and developed a control algorithm for Bluetooth-enabled teleoperation of the bot.
* Successfully integrated the control algorithm into a simulator to facilitate autonomous obstacle avoidance for the differential drive bot within the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework.
* Implemented advanced techniques such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and gap-following strategy for effective obstacle avoidance.
