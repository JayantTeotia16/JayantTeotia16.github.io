This study was completed during my research internship at ARTPARK. It incorporated the obstacle avoidance part of autonomous navigation of a ground robot in a cluttered environment using a vanilla mixing of object detection and depth information from a stereo camera. The image frame was divided into nine parts and the robot corrected its trajectory based on the detection and depth information.
