* Successfully trained and implemented object detection models, namely YOLO v3, Faster RCNN, and SSD, specifically tailored for underwater object detection. This resulted in an impressive accuracy rate of 93\%.
* Innovated a unique model named GaborNet, which leverages Gabor filters for efficient object classification.
* *Enhanced the performance of YOLO v3 by reducing its inference time from 0.02s to 0.012s on the Nvidia A6000 platform. This was achieved through strategic model pruning and knowledge distillation techniques.
* Devised a sophisticated ‘search monitor’ algorithm for a swarm of UAVs. This algorithm is capable of online ‘target drone’ detection and tracking. The search areas were optimally divided using Voronoi distance optimization, and path planning was conducted using minimum spanning tree coverage.
* Pioneered server and client-side programs using gRPC. These programs facilitate bi-directional data streaming via wifi networks, thereby reducing reliance on predefined APIs of Airsim and ROS.
