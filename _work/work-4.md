* Conducted an in-depth investigation into the optimization strategies utilized for Model Predictive Control within the VIATOC software.
* Executed simulations of a complex, non-linear mathematical model to facilitate overhead crane obstacle avoidance, leveraging Model Predictive Control.
* Led the benchmarking process of the auto-generated C++ code, evaluating performance under various linear and non-linear constraints on a Raspberry Pi 3B platform.
